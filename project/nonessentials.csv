Yes, these are real. The best Florida Man headlines of 2019
Grace Pateras
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. â€“ By now, we all know who
Florida Man
is.
Or, at least, we get the joke.
Earlier this year, a viral social media trend â€“\xa0the Florida Man Challenge â€“ became a game: Google "Florida Man" followed by your birthday and\xa0find out what news headline turns up.
The Florida Man joke is meant to imply that just one guy â€“ Florida Man â€“ is responsible for all of it,\xa0
according to the website Know Your Meme
. Oh, if only!
In any case, Florida Man kept right on going in 2019 and we're already awaiting the first Florida Man story of the new decade.\xa0
In the meantime, catch up with all that Florida Man has been up to this year.
Remember these?
