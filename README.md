# Escape-to-Miami

OverView:
Our "problem" that we are trying to solve is to make the world known of the notorious Florida Man that plauges the Southeast of the United 
States. Hence, we made a game, educating people about what the Florida Man is up to now a days. This game is supposed to be an homage to 
the classic game Oregon Trail, where a user has to navigate their way to Miami while in a vehicle. During this, random events occur that
are also caused by the weird, yet to natives these are natural, events that occur arround Florida. From the famed "Sublix" to alligators
sunning themselves on the road to even driving through a swamp as a shortcut, this game is meant to educate the masses of day-to-day life
in sunny Florida.

UI Instructions:
When starting up the game through the game.py file, users will see a screen that show a How To Play, Begin, and Quit button. Obviously,
these functions should all be self-explanatory, and upon start users begint he game and go through the intro screen before the game
starts. The inputs for the game are "n" for going to the next turn, "i" for viewing a players inventory, and "1" and "2" for whenever
a user needs to make a choice due to a random event. Other than that, hopefully everything else is obvious for users to navigate our
project.

List of Libraries:
Other than standard python, we used:
- beautifulsoup
- pygame
- random
- requests
- csv

List of Other Resources:
We used a few resources, one of them being images found on the internet. We also used the front pages of USA Today and Google
for webscraping and finding the headlines of articles about Florida Man.

Separation of Work:
Carissa and Megan were the main ones who got the project off the ground. They made the skeleton of what we needed at the beginning and
began working on other features. Alexander helped create the inventory and car class to create the user functions. Once the deadline
began closing on us, we split the work with Carissa doing the webscraping, Megan fine tuning the random events and the player inventory,
and Alexander making sure the actual game itself worked and implementing user input through buttons. Everyone helped around with each
other and would work outside their area of speciality every once in awhile, fixing bugs and making sure everything worked.
